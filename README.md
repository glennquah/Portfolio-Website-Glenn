# About this Project

This project was undertaken solely with vanilla HTML and CSS as part of my ongoing learning journey to master the fundamentals of web development. I deliberately chose this approach to challenge myself and deepen my understanding of core concepts. Despite the availability of frameworks like GatsbyJS or Next.js or styling libraries like bootstrap or tailwindcss, I opted to forego their use in favor of honing my skills with raw code. Building my portfolio website from scratch using only HTML and CSS has not only allowed me to grasp essential concepts more thoroughly but has also empowered me to craft a personalized, unique digital presence reflective of my journey and skills.
